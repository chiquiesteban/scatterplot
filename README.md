scatterplot
===========

A responsive scatterplot template, supports up to five variables of data.

Use the utils.js files to customize the scatterplot.
You can change the canvas ratio, the scale of bubbles and add up to five numeric variables (plus name of the element).

Use the json in utils.js to feed dato for the scatterplot. The variables work in this order:

Name, x axis, y axis, size of the bubble, color of the bubble, opacity of the bubble.

You don't need to use all of them, but at least name and x and y axis.
